Time spent: 6 hours.

## Work Completed

I certify that I completed all steps using my own computer.

**Part 3:** I noticed in the example output that the lowest grade, which was 4, was omitted completely. I was unsure if that was intentional or not. I think it makes more sense to include the failing grade in the output, which I did.
